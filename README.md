# Problem Statement
Imagine reading lots of research paper or any concise litereature out there, best we can do is re read them so we can understand and retain. What if i tell you there was a better way.
Let me tell you how, first step is to bring your literature and you will get concise and precise explaination with Flowcharts. 
So, that you can get Understanding of very concise literature with proper analogies.

# There are various challenges we ran into which includes
- Brainstroming for the project, 
- Finding the valid API key of OpenAi
- Authentication, Sending pdf's to the cloud
- Last min's bugs (we are still solving it lol).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
